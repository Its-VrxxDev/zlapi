A powerful and efficient library to interact with Zalo Website. 
This is *not* an official API, Zalo has that `over here <https://developers.zalo.me/docs>`__ for chat bots. This library differs by using a normal Zalo account instead (More flexible).

``zlapi`` currently support:

- Custom style for message.
- Sending many types of messages, with files, stickers, mentions, etc.
- Fetching messages, threads and users info.
- Creating groups, setting the group, creating polls, etc.
- Listening for, an reacting to messages and other events in real-time.
- And there are many other things.
- ``async``/``await`` (Coming Soon).

Essentially, everything you need to make an amazing Zalo Bot!


Caveats
-------

``zlapi`` works by imitating what the browser does, and thereby tricking Zalo into thinking it's accessing the website normally.

However, there's a catch! **Using this library may not comply with Zalo's Terms Of Service!**, so be We are not responsible if your account gets banned or disabled!

.. inclusion-marker-installation-end


Example Usage

    from zlapi.models import *
    
    imei = "<imei>"
    cookies = "<cookies>"

    client.send(Message(text="Hi Myself!"), thread_id=client.uid, thread_type=ThreadType.USER)

This project is a relocation
============================

This project is a project to be relocated from ``zaloapi`` because this module has been removed from Pypi and the reason is unknown.
